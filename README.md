#### Project Description
In this project, a multiple linear regression model was applied to predict housing prices. The model uses key features such as the number of rooms, number of bathrooms, and square footage (living area).

The dataset is structured to distinguish between basement level and above-ground level features. In the initial phase, a model was built using only the above-ground level data. Later, features related to the basement were also included in the dataset and the model was retrained.

Comparative analysis showed that basement features have a significant impact on housing prices. This finding highlights the importance of including basement-related data when performing housing valuation and resulted in improved model performance.

###### First Model: Used only above-ground features:
"GrLivArea", "BedroomAbvGr", "FullBath", "HalfBath", and the target variable "SalePrice".

##### Second Model: Included both above-ground and basement features:
"GrLivArea", "BedroomAbvGr", "FullBath", "HalfBath", "TotalBsmtSF", "BsmtFullBath", "BsmtHalfBath", and "SalePrice".


#### What is Linear Regression?
Linear regression is a statistical technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables using a linear equation.

##### ùë¶=ùëè0+ùëè1ùë•+ùúÄ

###### y : Dependent variable

###### x:  Independent variable

###### ùëè0 : Intercept

###### ùëè1 : Slope

###### Œµ : Error term

#### When is it Used?
* When there is a linear relationship between variables
* When you want to predict future values
* When you want to understand cause-effect relationships
* When data is limited but interpretability is important

#### Use Cases:
Economics: House price prediction

Healthcare: Relationship between age and blood pressure

Education: Exam score analysis

Marketing: Ad budget vs sales

#### Simple vs Multiple Regression:
Simple regression: One independent variable

Multiple regression: More than one independent variable
